# Example

You can check the bot here: [http://discord.gg/cKHPhpd](http://discord.gg/cKHPhpd)

Invite the bot to your server from [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=688845894837469246&scope=bot&permissions=101376)

## Installation

Install **axios**, **discord.js** or simply run this in your terminal after cloning the project:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
```
{
	"prefix": "!corona ", # You can edit to your preferred command
	"token": "" # Add your token from Discord Developer Portal > Bot, after creating your application
}
```

## Usage
I recommend using **nodemon** to have ease testing your changes without having to restart node manually.

**Nodemon**:

`
nodemon app.js
`

**Terminal**:

`
node .
`

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Note
This is my first time publishing an open-source project, excuse me if you are having difficulties dealing with the bot, or understanding the installation instructions, feel free to open an issue if you need help with anything
